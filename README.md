# Python_Keylogger

- Repository: `Python`
- Duration: `Small evening project`

## My Keylogger
This small repository is to have fun and learning more about the possibilities about python.  
It is also done because I know that some people might be interested in how it actually works.  
It is of course also done because even if I try to focus mainly on code right now I let myself already look a bit into cybersecurity/ethical hacking.

#### Pictures are yet to come...
##### Some things will be added.

Hope you found it interesting!
